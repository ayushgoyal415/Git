* The "status" command tells us about the status of the code, including
  - the branch we are using
  - is the code up to date
  - is there anything to commit
  - is the working tree clean

Basically it tells whether your local code is up to date with the remote code or not.

* Modified file vs Untracked file

Modified File: It is a file which the git is tracking but the code written inside has
been altered and not yet committed to the remote repository.

Untracked File: It is a new file that we add inside the local repository which the git
is not yet tracking. No matter how much code we modify, the git will label it as
untracked because git is not simply looking for code changes in it as yet. Once we commit
this new file to the remote repository, then the git will start tracking it normally.

* Staged file

It is a modified file which has been staged for changes. That is, we have added the file
and the file is ready for commit.

* Note (in VS code) the files appear as follows:

- Modified Files : 'M'
- Untracked Files : 'U'
- Staged Added Files : 'A'

Note: Only staged added files show 'A'. Both staged and un-staged modified files show 'M'
