* Git vs GitHub (Handling a change in the code)
Note: On GitHub you don't need to go through 2 step process of staging and then
committing. Here you can directly commit your changes.

* How to Edit
  - Open any file from the Repo >
  - Click on the "pencil icon" on the top right corner >
  - Edit the file >
  - Click on the "Commit Changes" button at top right corner >
  - A dialog box will appear asking for the commit message where you can add a suitable
    message depicting the change

Note: The commit message appears alongside the filename (this shows the most recent 
commit for each file)
