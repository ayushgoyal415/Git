* What are merge conflicts?
Merge conflicts occur when the Git is not able to automatically resolve differences in
the code. For eg. when there is alteration in the same line of code in 2 branches.
  eg: main branch: <p>This is a new feature: Button</p>
      feat branch: <p>This is a new feature: NavBar</p>

* How to handle merge conflicts using VS Code?
To handle merge conflicts, we have to manually tell the git about the changes we
want to keep and ignore.
- When we try to merge two branches with merge conflicts using VS code, the VS Code
  opens a merge conflict editor where you can easily deal with conflicts.
- If we changed the feature_branch, then we have to again add and then commit
- And then we can finally merge without any conflicts
