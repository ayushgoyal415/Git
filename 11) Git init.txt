* Using 'git init'

- Used to create a new git repo on local machine
- After making a local git repo, we might want to publish it to GitHub (remote repo)

* Using 'git remote -v'
Verifies and mentions the remote repo linked to the local git repo.
Note that the local git repo made using 'git init' is not yet linked to any remote repo.

* 'git remote vs git remote -v'
- 'git remote' tells us about the name of the remote repo which by default is 'origin'
- 'git remote -v' tells us about the (fetch and push) names and https links of the
   remote repo

* Linking local git repo to a remote git repo

Step 1: Create a remote git repo on GitHub

Step 2: Link the local repo to a remote repos by the following command
          git remote add origin < https link to the remote repo >

Step 3: Getting the name of remote repo
          git remote -v

Step 4: Getting the name of the branch
          git branch

Step 5: Pushing the contents of local repo to remote repo
          git push origin main
