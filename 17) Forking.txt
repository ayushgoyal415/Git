It is an option available on GitHub. Basically it is used to collaborate with others.

For eg. Let's say the you want to improve 'express.js'. In such case do the following :

- Go to GitHub and search for 'express'
- Fork the express
- Doing this will create a remote repository of express into your GitHub account
- Now you can alter the code as you would do normally
- After all is done, you can make a pull request to the express team to accept the
  changes you have made in the express code
