* Using 'git push origin main'

Uploads the local repo content to the remote repo :
- Here 'origin' is the name of remote repository
- Here 'main' is the name of branch in the remote repository

* Using 'git push -u origin main'

- 'u' stands for upstream
- Does everything that push does
- Also tells the git that in future we will be pushing to 'origin main' only. So that
  in future we can simply use 'git push' rather than writing the whole code again and
  again.
